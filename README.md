This is a basic Electron application based on the Quick Start Guide within the Electron documentation.

## To Use

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-electron-app
# Go into the repository
cd my-electron-app
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

## Structure of the project

The project has the following structure:

- `src/main.js`: This is the main script of your Electron application. It creates the main window and handles system events. It may import modules from the Electron API and other JavaScript files.

- `src/preload.js`: This script has access to node.js and Electron APIs. It is used to perform operations in the renderer process that have side effects in the main process.

- `src/renderer.js`: This script is used to control web pages. It runs in the renderer process and has access to a subset of Electron APIs.

- `package.json`: This is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project. It also contains metadata about the project like name, version, and description.

- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- `.gitignore`: This file tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It's usually used to avoid committing transient files from your working directory that aren't useful to other collaborators, such as compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that is loaded when your Electron application starts. It's the entry point into your app and essentially the "base" of your app.
